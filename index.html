        <p class="about-me">
            Am an imaginative and innovative developer. One of the best things I love about 
            this tech field is the team work. I have worked in different places outisde tech. 
            I had no idea about tech before a year ago and I had no access of computer half a year ago 
            after I had an access of computer at my work at that time and trying to figure out how to use a 
            computer and work on it of which I was trying to learn something about it at the time becouse I like to 
            try new things everytime. After six months or so I found out Software Development which made me curious of what 
            that means and how it works. Talking to several guys and also developer, I found interested in development and I 
            begun to do research abt that and started to learn about it after sometime. Now am in this field for six months.
